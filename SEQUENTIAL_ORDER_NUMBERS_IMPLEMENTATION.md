# Sequential Order Numbers Implementation

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a new sequential daily order numbering system that replaces the previous timestamp-based order numbers. This system provides more meaningful and user-friendly order numbers that reset daily and increment sequentially.

## What Changed

### Before (Old System)

- **OrderService.createOrder**: Used `ORD-${Date.now()}` (e.g., `ORD-1703123456789`)
- **basic-operations.ts**: Used `generateOrderNumber()` → `ORD-${Date.now()}-${randomString}`
- **split-operations.ts**: Used `SPLIT-${Date.now()}` (e.g., `SPLIT-1703123456789`)
- **merge-operations.ts**: Used `MERGED-${Date.now()}` (e.g., `MERGED-1703123456789`)

### After (New System)

- **All order creation methods**: Now use `generateSequentialOrderNumber(tenantId)`
- **Format**: `DDMMYY-XXX` where:
  - `DDMMYY` = Day-Month-Year (e.g., `160825` for August 16, 2025)
  - `XXX` = Sequential number starting from 001 each day

## Implementation Details

### New Function: `generateSequentialOrderNumber(tenantId)`

**Location**: `src/routes/v1/orders/helpers/order-formatters.ts`

**Features**:

- Generates sequential numbers for each day
- Tenant-scoped (each restaurant has its own sequence)
- Resets to 001 at midnight each day
- Handles gaps in sequence gracefully
- Fallback to timestamp-based if database fails

**Logic**:

1. Gets today's date in DDMMYY format
2. Queries database for highest order number for today for this tenant
3. Increments the highest number by 1
4. Formats with leading zeros (001, 002, 003, etc.)
5. Returns `DDMMYY-XXX` format

### Database Query

```sql
SELECT "orderNumber"
FROM orders
WHERE "tenantId" = $1
  AND DATE("createdAt") = DATE($2)
  AND "orderNumber" ~ '^${dateString}-[0-9]+$'
ORDER BY CAST(SUBSTRING("orderNumber" FROM '^${dateString}-([0-9]+)$') AS INTEGER) DESC
LIMIT 1
```

This query:

- Finds orders for the specific tenant and date
- Uses regex to match the new format
- Orders by the numeric part to find the highest
- Extracts the number using substring and regex

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/routes/v1/orders/helpers/order-formatters.ts`

- Added `generateSequentialOrderNumber()` function
- Added `extractSequentialNumber()` function for frontend optimization

- Now returns `sequentialNumber` field for frontend

### 7. `src/routes/v1/kitchen.ts`

- Updated to use `formatOrderFromRows` formatter

## Benefits

### 1. **User-Friendly**

- Easy to read and understand (e.g., "Order 160825-001")
- Quick identification of order date
- Sequential numbering makes sense to staff and customers

### 2. **Frontend Optimized**

- **Database stores**: Full format (`160825-001`)
- **Frontend receives**: Just the sequential number (`001`)
- Clean UI display: "Order #001" instead of "Order #160825-001"
- Easier sorting and searching by order number

### 3. **Daily Reset**

- Each day starts fresh with order #1
- No confusion about order age
- Better for daily reporting and tracking

### 4. **Tenant Isolation**

- Each restaurant has its own sequence
- No conflicts between different locations
- Maintains data integrity

### 5. **Gap Handling**

- If orders are deleted or cancelled, gaps don't affect new orders
- System always finds the next available number
- Robust against data inconsistencies

### 6. **Fallback Safety**

- If database query fails, falls back to timestamp-based numbers
- Ensures system continues to work even with database issues
- Maintains backward compatibility

## Example Order Numbers

### Today (August 16, 2025)

- First order: `160825-001`
- Second order: `160825-002`
- Third order: `160825-003`
- Tenth order: `160825-010`
- Hundredth order: `160825-100`

### Tomorrow (August 17, 2025)

- First order: `170825-001` (resets to 001)
- Second order: `170825-002`

## Complete API Coverage

### All GET Endpoints Now Return Sequential Numbers

The `sequentialNumber` field is now available in **ALL** order-related GET endpoints:

### Role Permissions Fixed

**Kitchen Routes** are now accessible to **WAITER** and **CASHIER** roles:

- ✅ **Before**: Only KITCHEN, MANAGER, TENANT_ADMIN could access kitchen routes
- ✅ **After**: WAITER, CASHIER, KITCHEN, MANAGER, TENANT_ADMIN can all access kitchen routes
- ✅ **Reason**: Waiters and cashiers need to view order status and update item statuses

#### ✅ **Core Order Endpoints**

- `GET /api/orders` - Get all orders
- `GET /api/orders/cancelled` - Get cancelled orders
- `GET /api/orders/:orderId` - Get single order

#### ✅ **Public Endpoints**

- `GET /api/v1/public/orders/:orderId` - Public order status (QR customers)

#### ✅ **Kitchen Endpoints**

- `GET /api/v1/kitchen/orders` - Kitchen orders list (accessible to WAITER, CASHIER, KITCHEN, MANAGER, TENANT_ADMIN)
- `GET /api/v1/kitchen/orders/:orderId` - Kitchen order details (accessible to WAITER, CASHIER, KITCHEN, MANAGER, TENANT_ADMIN)
- `GET /api/v1/kitchen/dashboard` - Kitchen dashboard (accessible to WAITER, CASHIER, KITCHEN, MANAGER, TENANT_ADMIN)
- `PUT /api/v1/kitchen/orders/:orderId/items/:itemId/status` - Update item status (accessible to WAITER, CASHIER, KITCHEN, MANAGER, TENANT_ADMIN)

#### ✅ **Other Endpoints**

- All order creation responses (POST endpoints)
- All order modification responses (PUT/PATCH endpoints)
- All order split/merge responses

### Frontend Optimization

### What the Frontend Receives

Instead of sending the full order number like `160825-001`, the API now sends just the sequential number:

```json
{
  "id": "order_123",
  "orderNumber": "001", // Just the sequential number (was "160825-001")
  "tableNumber": "5",
  "status": "active",
  "createdAt": "2025-08-16T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Frontend Benefits

1. **Clean Display**: Show "Order #001" instead of "Order #160825-001"
2. **Easy Sorting**: Sort by sequential number (1, 2, 3...) instead of string sorting
3. **Simple Search**: Users can search for "order 001" without date context
4. **Better UX**: Staff quickly identify order sequence without parsing dates
5. **Responsive Design**: Shorter numbers fit better in mobile interfaces
6. **No Breaking Changes**: Frontend continues to use `orderNumber` field as before

### Frontend Usage Examples

```javascript
// Display order number (no changes needed!)
const orderDisplay = `Order #${order.orderNumber}`; // "Order #001"

// Sort orders by sequence (no changes needed!)
orders.sort((a, b) => parseInt(a.orderNumber) - parseInt(b.orderNumber));

// Search functionality (no changes needed!)
const orderSearch = (query) => {
  return orders.filter(
    (order) => order.orderNumber.includes(query) || order.id.includes(query)
  );
};

// Navigation (no changes needed!)
const nextOrder = orders.find(
  (o) => parseInt(o.orderNumber) === parseInt(currentOrder.orderNumber) + 1
);
```

## Migration Notes

### Existing Orders

- Existing orders with old format remain unchanged
- New orders will use the new format
- Mixed formats may exist during transition period

### Database Impact

- No schema changes required
- New query pattern for order number generation
- Minimal performance impact (single query per order creation)

### Backward Compatibility

- Old order numbers are still valid
- System can handle mixed formats
- Fallback ensures system reliability

## Testing

The implementation has been tested to ensure:

- ✅ Correct date formatting (DDMMYY)
- ✅ Sequential numbering (001, 002, 003...)
- ✅ Daily reset functionality
- ✅ Tenant isolation
- ✅ Gap handling
- ✅ Fallback mechanisms
- ✅ TypeScript compilation
- ✅ Import/export functionality

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Custom Prefixes**: Allow restaurants to customize the prefix (e.g., `REST-160825-001`)
2. **Time-based**: Include time in format (e.g., `160825-1430-001` for 2:30 PM)
3. **Category-based**: Different sequences for different order types
4. **Caching**: Cache daily sequences for better performance
5. **Analytics**: Track order volume patterns by time of day

### Monitoring

- Monitor for any performance issues with the new query
- Track adoption of new format
- Ensure fallback mechanisms work as expected

## Conclusion

The new sequential order number system provides a significant improvement in usability and clarity while maintaining system reliability and backward compatibility. The implementation is robust, well-tested, and ready for production use.
